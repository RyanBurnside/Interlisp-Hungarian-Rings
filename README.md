This is a variation on the Hungarian Rings puzzle written in InterLisp for the Medley Interlisp system.

To play the game you have two options.
*ONLINE* https://interlisp.org/software/access-online/
1. Use the online Medley Environment and upload the RING.LISP file using the button on the VM there.
2. Right click a blank space on the desktop and select EXEC from the menu. (Drag out the window it's prompting for)
3. Type (LOAD "RING.LISP") to load the file you've uploaded.
4. In the same Exec window type (HUNGARIAN.RINGS) and the game will prompt you to position 2 windows. One is the live puzzle and the other is a card with a solved picture.
5. To play the game simply click inside the loop you wish to shift. Left click rotates left, right rotates right.
6. To quit the game middle click the puzzle window and select 'Close'. (the other window can be right clicked and 'close' selected.

*OFFLINE* https://interlisp.org/software/install-and-run/
1. Place the file in the root directory of your medley install and follow steps 2 onward.
This may be '~/il/' for me on Linux. Consult the docs for where your root directory for medley is otherwise.
